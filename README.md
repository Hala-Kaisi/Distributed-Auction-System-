#Basic Command-Line Auction System

-------------------------------------------------------------

##Overview

    The following files contain parts of a basic auction system that operate via terminal.

##Guidelines to run the auction system

    1- Set the _server_ folder and the _Client_ folder in seperate paths.
    
    2- Insert the file path, at which the public keys are stored (here named _SecretKey.txt_ If you wish to change the name of this file, remember to change it as well in the path), in the _Server.java_ file in the _server_ folder and in the _Client.java_ file in the _Client_ folder (The exact locations at where to insert the path are set under #TODO statements - instead of the String containing 'XXXXXX')
    
    3- Compile and run as many servers you want, and as many clients as you want, but make sure to run and compile the frontend first
